Hey guys, my name is Michael. I just set up this site which I'm quite excited about. If you don't know who I am, feel free to [find out](/about.html).

Anyways, this site uses GitHub Pages which means I don't have to run my website off my home server. Yay. I've got a pretty sweet workflow set up with Grunt, Bower, npm, etc. [Check it out](https://github.com/micthiesen/micthiesen.github.io) if you want, it works well for me.

I've also been introduced to Jekyll which I'm beginning to love. Writing blog posts in Markdown and publishing with Git? Awesome! It's a beautiful thing.

Expect to see more posts. I'll write about anything that interests me, which means I'll probably write about technology.
